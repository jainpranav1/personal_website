                Git is an incredible tool for anyone who works with files.
                Essentially, git is a time machine for your files. It allows you
                to take snapshots of your files at different times. You can then
                travel through time to different snapshots whenever necessary.
              </p>
              <p>
                One problem with git though is that it is difficult to visualize
                what each of the commands are doing. This is why I created the
                <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PranavJain.git-visualizer"
                  class="link-primary" target="_blank">Git Visualizer</a>
                , a vs code extension that visualizes git graphs to help you
                learn about git. The visualization style was inspired by the
                git-learning game
                <a href="https://ohmygit.org/" class="link-primary" target="_blank">Oh My Git</a>, which I highly
                recommend.

                is a great course in which students build a modern computer from
                logic gates. One issue though is that there did not exist any
                tool to generate helpful visualizations of the nand2tetris hdl
                file, a type of file used to describe the structure of chips. As
                an honors project for my CSCE 312 class (Computer Organization),
                I worked remotely in a team of 5 to develop a

              <p>
                I later updated the tool by developing it into a

                One winter, my older brother (a medical student) was discussing
                a problem that he faces while studying. For his medical exams,
                he needs to study diagrams. The problem is that to quiz himself
                on his diagram knowledge, he has to manually cover up the
                diagram labels by himself or hope that another classmate has
                already done so. For TAMUhack 2022, my team, inspired by this
                problem, developed
                <a href="https://devpost.com/software/blockify" class="link-primary" target="_blank">Blockify</a>. This
                tool can cover labels in diagrams to help students study
                more effectively for tests.

                Due to covid, many individuals have found themselves learning
                and working remotely. Although remote work is convenient, it is
                very straining on your eyes to be staring at a computer screen
                for the entire day. The symptoms for eye strain include
                headaches and eye pain, among others. For TAMUhack 2021, my
                team, inspired by this problem, developed
                <a href="https://devpost.com/software/eyetrain" class="link-primary" target="_blank">EyeTrain</a>. This
                is a game that exercises your eyes through different eye
                movements and blinking. Our team achieved 2nd place out of 130
                teams. Each of us received an iPad (8th Generation) as a prize.

                In many of my classes, I noticed that my teachers were
                recommending that we use our past quizzes as study material for
                upcoming exams. One issue though is that studying from quizzes
                is difficult because the answers are often right next to the
                question. To address this problem, I developed
                <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/coverup/hnmphpcheiijfaegncemlieifeeigbho"
                  class="link-primary" target="_blank">CoverUp</a>. The tool places rectangles on a user's screen, which
                can be
                dragged, resized, deleted, and copied in order to cover answers.
                I published this tool on the Chrome Web Store as a google

                When attending Aggies Invent - Facebook, my team of 6 learned about a
                problem that exists at Facebook. When outages happen at Facebook
                data centers, technicians need to resolve the problems quickly.
                Their preferred method for travelling throughout these huge
                centers is golf carts. One issue is that locating these golf
                carts can be difficult, and often the carts are out of battery.
                To solve this issue, my team developed TeeRacking. This
                product provides information to Facebook employees about nearby,
                functioning golf carts through an app. Our team achieved 2nd place
                out of 8 teams. Each of us received $125 as a prize.

                we produced had several features. Our website had a point system
                in which members could receive points for attending different
                events (after entering the event code into the website). Our
                website also had a newsletter system so officers could keep
                their members updated on the latest TAMU ASLA news. In this
                project, I served as the scrum master. Some of my duties
