                I worked in-person as a full-time, paid computer science intern
                for 40 hours per week for 10 weeks in Plano, TX. I really
                enjoyed my experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                I worked with three other interns on the Solution Catalog
                project. This project was inspired by the following problem.
                Business analysts (BA) and product owners (PO) would not be able
                to independently view and edit the eligibility rules of
                different capital one solutions. Instead, they would need to ask
                software engineers to perform these tasks for them using SQL
                scripts. The goal of this project was to develop a website that
                enabled BAs and POs to view and edit these rules themselves.
              </p>
              <p>
                Throughout my internship, I worked on the frontend side of the
                Solution Catalog project. I used
                <a href="https://lit.dev/" class="link-primary" target="_blank"
                  >Lit Element</a
                >
                for developing web components to reduce code, used

                  class="link-primary"

                  >Web Pack</a
                >
                as our bundler to reduce load time, used

                as our programming language to reduce bugs, and used

                  >Axios</a
                >
                as our http client in order to allow our frontend to communicate
                with out backend. I also used
                <a
                  href="https://modern-web.dev/docs/test-runner/overview/"
                  class="link-primary"

                  >Web Test Runner</a

                which made use of
                <a

                >
                for developing unit tests.
              </p>

              <p>
                Apart from development, I had lots of fun attending different
                Capital One events and meeting other Capital One interns and
                employees. I especially enjoyed our final intern celebration in
                which all the interns were flown out to the headquarters of
                Capital One in Mclean, Virginia.

                I worked remotely as a full-time, paid computer science intern
                for 40 hours per week for 12 weeks. Overall, I had a really
                great experience. I met a alot of different types of people,
                including a consultant, product manager, and technical lead. I
                also worked on the following projects:
              </p>

              <p>
                <b>myPKFiT Isitup project:</b>
                I developed a Node JS based tool that can check the login page
                status of the myPKFiT site for over 50 countries every 15
                minutes. Before this tool, the myPKFiT team would only know
                about login issues after their users had already experienced
                them. My program allowed the team to know about and fix issues
                before users experience them, providing a better site experience
                for users.
              </p>

              <p>
                <b>HCP Specification Documentation:</b>
                Along with a fellow intern, I developed a document containing
                the functionalities and formatting data of the myPKFiT web
                application for over 50 countries. To reduce human error in data
                collection, I developed a Node JS based tool that automatically
                extracted the formatting data for each country's web application
                and placed the data into an excel file. This document was
                presented to the myPKFiT quality team and now resides in the
                myPKFiT technical file.
              </p>

              <p>
                <b>myPKFiT Screenshot Automation Tool:</b>
                I developed a tool that can automatically extract screenshots
                from the myPKFiT site and add them to a word document. This tool
                was developed to remove the need for manually collecting and
                adding screenshots to user manuals, a process that took
                approximately 3 hours per country. While my tool was only a
                proof of concept, once fully extended by future developers, the
                screenshot collection process will take 10-20 minutes and be
                fully automated.
