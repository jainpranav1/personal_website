                                I worked remotely as a full-time, paid computer science intern for 40 hours per week for

                                <b>myPKFiT Isitup project:</b>
                                I developed a Node JS based tool that can check the login page status of the myPKFiT
                                site for over 50 countries every 15
                                minutes. Before this tool, the myPKFiT team would only know about login issues after
                                their users had already experienced
                                them. My program allowed the team to know about and fix issues before users experience
                                them, providing a better site
                                experience for users.
                            </p>

                                <b>HCP Specification Documentation:</b>
                                Along with a fellow intern, I developed a document containing the functionalities and
                                formatting data of the myPKFiT web
                                application for over 50 countries. To reduce human error in data collection, I developed
                                a Node JS based tool that
                                automatically extracted the formatting data for each country's web application and
                                placed the data into an excel file.
                                This document was presented to the myPKFiT quality team and now resides in the myPKFiT
                                technical file.

                                <b>myPKFiT Screenshot Automation Tool:</b>
                                I developed a tool that can automatically extract screenshots from the myPKFiT site and
                                add them to a word document.
                                This tool was developed to remove the need for manually collecting and adding
                                screenshots to user manuals, a process
                                that took approximately 3 hours per country. While my tool was only a proof of concept,
                                once fully extended by future
                                developers, the screenshot collection process will take 10-20 minutes and be fully
                                automated.
